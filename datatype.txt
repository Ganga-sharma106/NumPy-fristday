Reshaping means changing the shape of an array.
V - fixed chunk of memory for other type ( void )

COPY - The copy SHOULD NOT be affected by the changes made to the original array.
VIEW - The view SHOULD be affected by the changes made to the original array.

Shap - NumPy arrays have an attribute called shape that returns a tuple with each index having the number of corresponding elements.

ndmin - ndmin ensures a minimum number of dimensions and The shape of the array changes based on the ndmin value.

Reshaping - changing the shape of an array.

Understanding the Shape (2, 3, 2)
2 → Number of blocks (Depth)
3 → Number of rows per block
2 → Number of columns per row

reshape(2, 2, -1) allows NumPy to automatically compute the missing dimension.

Flattening array - converting a multidimensional array into a 1D array.(We can use reshape(-1) to do this.)

Sorting array - means putting elements in an ordered sequence.(using sort() )

 Filtering Arrays - If the value at an index is True that element is contained in the filtered array, 
                     if the value at that index is False that element is excluded from the filtered array.

Searching Arrays:-
You can search an array for a certain value, and return the indexes that get a match.(use the where() method.)


searchsorted() which performs a binary search in the array, 
and returns the index where the specified value would be inserted to maintain the search order.

np.nditer efficiently iterates over NumPy arrays.
The buffered flag allows temporary data type conversion.
The op_dtypes=['S'] converts integer elements into byte strings.

arr[:, ::2]
: → Selects all rows.
::2 → Selects every second column (i.e., columns at index 0 and 2)

arr[:, ::1]
: → Selects all rows.
::1 → Selects every column with step 1 (which means it does not skip any columns).
Since ::1 keeps all columns unchanged, this slicing does nothing and returns the same array.

np.ndenumerate() - 
It enumerates over a NumPy array and returns both:
The index (as a tuple).
The value at that index.
It works for both 1D and multi-dimensional arrays.

stacking is done along a new axis.
axis=1 means concatenation is done horizontally (column-wise).
axis=0 (Row-wise Stacking)

hstack() to stack along rows.

vstack()  to stack along columns.

dstack() to stack along height, which is the same as depth.
